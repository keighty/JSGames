<p>Help Ruby learn about Animals!</p>
<p>Start by thinking of an animal. Ruby will ask you a series of yes/no questions about that animal: Does it swim? Does it have hair? And so on.... Eventually, Ruby will narrow down the possibilities to a single animal and guess: is it a mouse?</p>
<p>If Ruby has guessed correctly, the game is over and may be restarted with a new animal. If Ruby was wrong, she will ask you for the kind of animal they were thinking of. Help Ruby get better at the game by suggesting a question that can help her distinguish between her incorrect guess and the correct answer. She will remember for next time!</p>
